# javascript_basics
This repository basically contains the important concepts of JavaScript that I have learnt right from beginner level to intermediate level.
Starting with the data types and varible declaration, there are other topics like arrays, Strings and their methods that are regularly used. 
Moreover there are small notes that might help the reader to understand these topics aswell.
Other importatn topics included are Objects, Object destructuring, Functions and parameters, JSON APIS, with basic concept of loops and conditional statements.
